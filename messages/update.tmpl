You are provided with a previous input file, the previous output file that was generated based on the previous input file, and a current input file. Your task is to compare the previous and current inputs, identify the differences, and update the previous output to align with the changes in the current input. Preserve all elements of the previous output, which are not related to the current input.

---
Previous input:
`````
{{ .PreviousIn }}
`````

---
Previous output:
`````
{{ .PreviousOut }}
`````

---
Current input:
`````
{{ .In }}
`````

---
Output file name: {{ .OutputPath }} 

{{- if .Prompt }}
Consider the following user request, which clarifies how the input should be transformed into the output: {{ .Prompt }}
{{- end }}

Output only the updated content of the file and nothing else. Do not wrap your output into Markdown code block. Do not request clarification from the user, as this session is non-interactive.
